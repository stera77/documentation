<h1>6. Users<a class="headerlink" href="#users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>User management with enStratus is tightly integrated with enStratus accounts, groups,
roles, and budget codes. Let&#8217;s define a few terms that will help provide useful
context for understanding how users work.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Company. A company is a logical entity in enStratus that contains one or more accounts.
When the first account is created, a company name is required.</li>
<li>Account. A account has a one to one relationship with a set of cloud credentials tied
to a cloud provider.</li>
<li>Group. A group is visible company-wide. Users can be assigned one or more groups. Each
group can have 0 or 1 role applied to it.</li>
<li>Role. A role is also visible company-wide. Roles are the mechanism through which access
rights are managed. A role of the same name may have different access rights applied on
the account level.</li>
<li>Budget Code. Budget codes are visible company-wide and costs are aggregated across all
accounts.</li>
</ol>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/companies.png"><img alt="Companies and Accounts" src="../_images/companies.png" style="width: 500.0px; height: 400.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Companies and Accounts</p>
</div>
<p>In the above example, we have two companies being managed through enStratus and tied to one
or more cloud accounts. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at each company.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/companyOne.png"><img alt="Company One" src="../_images/companyOne.png" style="width: 500.0px; height: 400.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Company One</p>
</div>
<p>The first company example is a simple example showing one company and one account. Here
there are only two users, each having potentially differing levels of access to the
underlying cloud depending on how their respective roles are configured. Group one is
assigned role one and group two is assigned role 2.</p>
<p>It is possible that role 1 and role 2 are identical and therefore each user will have the
same capabilities, although doing so is not practical.</p>
<p>The other primary difference between these two users is at the level of the bugdet code.
User 1 has only one budget code against which to charge, in this case the code called DEV.
User 2 has access to both the DEV and PRD budget codes.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/companyTwo.png"><img alt="Company Two" src="../_images/companyTwo.png" style="width: 500.0px; height: 400.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Company Two</p>
</div>
<p>Company two displays a more complex account relationship with more users, groups, and
roles. Here, there are two groups and three roles.</p>
<p>The first highlight to notice is that the group definitions for group 1 are different in
each account. In account 1, group one is assigned role 1, in account 2, group one is
assigned role 3. The practicality of such a design depends on what you’re trying to
accomplish in each account.</p>
<p>The effect of such a group and role mapping is on User 1. If User 1 is operating in the
first account, tied to AWS in this case, he or she will inherit the access rights from
Role 1. If User 1 switches to the second account, tied to OpenStack, they inherit access
rights from Role 2.</p>
<p>The other interesting user in this case is User 3. This user as been assigned into two
groups, Groups 1 and 2. When a user is assigned into two groups, the User inherits the sum
of the access rights. So in this case, User 3 is inheriting access rights from role 3 and
role 2, which are assigned to groups 1 and 2, respectively.</p>
<p>Budget codes for company 2 are visible across the entire company. This means charges to
the DEV and PRD budget codes, regardless of account, will aggregate and be shown in the
companies budget code summary. Users can be assigned into one or many budget codes.</p>
<div class="section" id="managing-users">
<h2>6.1. Managing Users<a class="headerlink" href="#managing-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The challenge of user management breaks down roughly along two boundaries. The first of
which is enStratus console access and the second is access rights to an individual cloud
resource such as a server.</p>
<p>The elasticity inherent in cloud computing creates a unique challenge for enterprise shell
and remote desktop access. enStratus operates as an arbiter between your authoritative
user database and user access to cloud virtual machines. Because of this arbitration, your
cloud virtual machines do not need to participate in any kind of trust relationship with
a corporate directory service.</p>
<p>enStratus acts as this arbiter by adding individual user accounts to virtual machines
based on the users enStratus access rights to that VM. enStratus maintains a separate set
of login credentials for VM access so that corporate passwords are never placed in a
public cloud.</p>
<p>Any enStratus user may be granted shell/remote desktop access to a cloud virtual machine
if that user has shell access rights to that virtual machine. If you want to grant a user
access to a virtual machine, they must have first created Linux (SSH) or Windows
(password) credentials in enStratus. You can then select the virtual machine to which they
should be granted access and then grant them access to the virtual machine. When you grant
that access, a new user account is created on the virtual machine with that users
authentication credentials.</p>
<p>If you remove the user from enStratus, enStratus also removes all virtual machine access
as well.</p>
<p>To create a new user, navigate to User Manager &gt; Users. Click on the + add user link in
the upper right of the User List and complete the resulting dialog box. After providing
the required information the user will be added to the user list.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/newUserDialog.png"><img alt="New User" src="../_images/newUserDialog.png" style="width: 500.0px; height: 400.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">New User</p>
</div>
<p>Once the user is added to the system, they will inherit the rights associated with the
group(s) to which they have been added.</p>
<p>A user must specify remote access credentials prior to gaining access to individual
running servers in the cloud. To gain access to a running Windows server, the user must
specify an RDP password. To access a Linux server, a user must specify a public SSH key.</p>
<p>To associate these credentials, click on their name at the top of the console, and select
Edit my profile. On the profile page, the RDP password should be entered twice before
saving the changes to the profile. The SSH public key can be entered either as a string or
uploaded as a file.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p class="caption">Edit Profile</p>
</div>
<p>Once the credentials have been entered and the profile is saved, the user can then access
remote servers as outlined in the Infrastructure &gt; Servers section through Shell/Remote
access provided they have the appropriate access rights to take this action.</p>

<h3>6.2.1. How roles affect users<a class="headerlink" href="#how-roles-affect-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve been saying that a user &#8216;inherit&#8217; access rights from the role assigned
to the group(s) they are assigned. Roles have very granular access control definitions
which are useful when defining the type and level of access users in a group should have.
The enforcement of access controls is done through the enStratus console. A user may see a
limited set of options when clicking on the actions link for a cloud resource.</p>
<p>In the SaaS version of enStratus this is the method by which enStratus enforces access
controls.</p>
<p>In an on-premise deployment, customers may choose the option to completely hide cloud
resources to which a user has no access. Again, this enforcement is done through the
enStratus console, except in this case if a user has no access to a cloud resource, the
resource is not presented to the user.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="access-rights">
<h2>6.3. Access Rights<a class="headerlink" href="#access-rights" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>The real power of the enStratus user security approach is unlocked when working with
Roles.</strong></p>
<p>Roles control user access to the enStratus console. Roles are assigned to Groups in a
one-to-one relationship. Each role contains a customizable collection of access rights.
Each access right provides access to a certain element of the enStratus console.</p>
<div class="section" id="terms">
<h3>6.3.1. Terms<a class="headerlink" href="#terms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>RESOURCE:</strong></p>
<p>Every page, link and action in the enStratus console is controlled by at
least one resource. In most cases, resources correspond to pages. For example, access to
the actions available on the Machine Images page is controlled by the IMAGE resource and
access to the actions available on the Servers page is controlled by the SERVER resource.
Read access and account administration is controlled by the CONSOLE resource.</p>
<p><strong>ACTION:</strong></p>
<p>Resources are divided into actions. If you want access to all actions within a
resource use the ANY action. If you want the role to have more granular permissions select
the specific actions you want users to be able to perform. For example, if you want users
with your role to be able to start deployments and services add the Deployment-Launch action.
Some console actions require multiple resource-action pairs. These are documented in the
Important Combinations sections for each resource.</p>
<p><strong>QUALIFIER:</strong></p>
<p>There are five different qualifiers: ANY, GROUP, THIS GROUP, BILLING, and
MINE. These represent ownership of resources such as servers and machine images. For exam-
ple, when a user launches a server they can associate it with a group and a billing code.
The server that is launched is owned by the group and billing code assigned to it and the
user who launched it. With access rights you can limit access to the server to users who
belong to the group you chose, the chosen billing code, or the user who launched the
server.</p>
<p>If you want users in your role to have access to all servers you can use the ANY
qualifier. For some resources, such as console and firewall, the group, this group,
billing, and mine qualifiers have no meaning because there is no ownership associated with
the resource. In these cases you should always use ANY when adding access rights.</p>
<p>Note: Ownership of some resources are still under development.</p>
