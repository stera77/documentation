<p>The purpose of this section is to walk through the deployment configuration options in
enStratus.</p>
<p>In the <a class="reference external" href="../introduction/overview.html">Overview</a> section, we covered the concepts
involved with creating an enStratus deployment.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<p>Before approaching deployment configuration, you should have in hand the
following components:</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>Working machine images/templates with the enStratus agent installed and tested.</li>
<li>Service images for each application/database to be installed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>4.1. User Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#user-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The enStratus automation interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to operate. There
are several sections of the enStratus console that are relevant to interacting with and
configuring automation.</p>
<p>The deployment designer interface allows the user to build an application architecture
using the enStratus web console.</p>

supports multiple types of load balancers through different mechanisms.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<h3>4.3.1. Physical<a class="headerlink" href="#physical" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A virtual machine based load balancer can use HA-Proxy, mod-jk, or zeus as a load
balancer. When a service is connected to a virtual machine based load balancer, The agent
script /enstratus/bin/startProxy is used to signal the load balancer that a new
application server has joined the pool. The agent script /enstratus/bin/stopProxy is used
to signal the load balancer that an application server has left the pool.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="virtual-example-elb">
<h3>4.3.2. Virtual (Example: ELB)<a class="headerlink" href="#virtual-example-elb" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some cloud providers support service-based load balancing in the from of a virtual load
balancer. In AWS, this is called an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). In cloudstack (cloud.com)
clouds, sometimes this is called a Router Virtual Machine (RVM). If your cloud provider
has this concept with API support, enStratus can support it.</p>
<p>If a service is tied to a virtual load balancer, the server upon which that service runs
will be added to and dropped from the load balancer via api calls. Furthermore, if the
load balancer is set to balance traffic to a specific zone or zones, enStratus will ensure
that your application servers only start in those zones.</p>
<p>Load balancing is connected to the deployment at the <em>service</em> level with enStratus. An
important point which will be illustrated shortly.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">It is possible to associate multiple load balancers with a deployment. This
feature is useful when working in a cross-cloud or in a massively scaled, geographically
disperse environment.</p>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/addLoadBalancer.png"><img alt="Adding a Load Balancer" src="../_images/addLoadBalancer.png" style="width: 550.0px; height: 300.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Adding a Load Balancer</p>
</div>
<p>Load balancer configuration options are:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Account</strong></p>
<p>The account specifies the account to which the load balancer is provisioned. If the
administrator is a member of multiple accounts, there may be multiple options here.
One possibility here is to have a load balancer span across several clouds. For example, a
load balancer may be provisioned into a cloud.com cloud with application servers in both
EC2 and in cloud.com</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Region</strong></p>
<p>It is possible to have a load balancer span regions within a cloud. For example, the EC2
cloud has at the time of this writing 5 regions.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>The scope parameter has three different settings:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Global</strong></p>
<p>A global setting will cause the load balancer to balance across regions, but is
nonsensical for virtual load balancing offerings such as an ELB.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Regional</strong></p>
<p>A regional load balancer will balance traffic to only one region, and evenly
to all data centers within that region.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Data Center</strong></p>
<p>A data center setting will balance to specific data centers. This type of
load balancing only makes sense for virtual load balancing offerings such as an ELB where
data centers (zones) can be specified prior to launch. This setting is non-sensical for
VM-based load balancing where no such option exists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>There are three types load balancer that can be provisioned within enStratus:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Cloud</strong></p>
<p>A cloud load balancer is a virtual load balancer such as an Amazon EC2 Elastic
Load Balancer. If the cloud provider has no such concept, there will be no option
presented.</p>
<p>In order for this option to be presented, a cloud load balancer must have already been
provisioned.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>VM Dynamic</strong></p>
<p>A VM Dynamic load balancer means that at the time of deployment start,
enStratus will provision a virtual server from the specified template with the appropriate
resources, and launch it into the specified fireall. If a VM Dynamic load balancer is
provisioned, it will benefit from auto-recovery.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>VM Static</strong></p>
<p>A VM Static load balancer will &#8220;convert&#8221; an existing virtual machine
into a load balancer by calling the /enstratus/bin/startProxy script on the VM specified
at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Currently, VM Static load balancer do not benefit from auto-recovery. If auto-recovery is
desired, use a VM Dynamic load balancer instead.</p>

<h2>4.4. Machine Images/Templates<a class="headerlink" href="#machine-images-templates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Creating &#8220;golden&#8221; or &#8220;master&#8221; images is common practice. Best practice is to
utilize tools that are specially suited the task of configuration management. enStratus
can leverage the power of both Chef and/or Puppet. enStratus also offers its own
configuration management engine that is a good introduction to the concept.</p>
</div>
<p>A machine image is a template from which servers are started. This document assumes a high
degree of familiarity with the process of image creation and maintenance. Methods for
maintaining machines with respect to versioning will be addressed. In an automated
environment, the enStratus agent <em>must</em> be installed on a template prior to configuring a
deployment.</p>
<div class="section" id="versioning">
<h3>4.4.1. Versioning<a class="headerlink" href="#versioning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are operating in a deployment, enStratus can help you manage the version of machine
image you are using in your launch configurations. This concept is addressed as part of
the auto-rollout feature of enStratus.</p>
<p>In short, you should patch servers running in your deployment as you see fit, and ensure
you maintain an equally patched version of the AMI defined in your launch configuration so
that when/if a scale or recovery event occurs, you utilize the correct machine image
version for the newly created servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dependencies">
<h3>4.4.2. Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#dependencies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>enStratus has very few true dependencies. It depends on Java, so ensure you have the
latest JDK installed to support the Agent. Additionally, when you are operating in an
automated deployment environment, we recommend installing the following software:</p>

<h2>4.5. Services<a class="headerlink" href="#services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Services are software objects in the form of files, typically tarred, zipped, or gzipped.
Services must be uploaded to cloud storage before configuring the deployment.</p>
<p>A service &#8220;image&#8221; is a zip file that can be uploaded to enStratus and then selected for
use in an automated deployment environment. Services are installed on tiers, and have
several configuration options, one of which can accomplish the logical connections between
services known as dependencies.</p>

<p>A data source can be a database backup file. For example, for a MySQL database, the data
source may be represented by a file with a .sql extension. This file is downloaded from
cloud storage during the start and configuration of a service that has associated a data
source.</p>

<p>Data sources are used when configuring a service. More is said about this in the
section on Tiers, which hold services. A data source is a database backup file, typically
in the form of a &#8220;dump&#8221; file of the form database1.sql. Data sources, like
services, should be uploaded into cloud storage before configuring the deployment.</p>

<h2>4.7. Volumes<a class="headerlink" href="#volumes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Volumes will be provisioned automatically by enStratus during deployment start according
to the parameters set as part of the launch configuration. enStratus uses volumes if they
exist with the cloud provider to execute scaling and recovery events.</p>
<p>Volumes are mounted on servers running in a tier at /mnt/services for Linux servers and at
H:/services for windows servers. Services are automatically assigned a serviceID which
becomes a directory within /mnt/services or H:/services of the form a1234. The path to the
service will be of the form /mnt/services/a1234, where a1234 is an automatically generated
identifier.</p>

<h2>4.8. Launch Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#launch-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A launch configuration is a definition that governs the resources provisioned to support a
virtual machine. At one level, this is roughly analogous to the size definitions provided
for by some clouds, such as in Amazon AWS small, medium, large, etc.  For enStratus a
launch configuration includes this definition, but goes beyond to include attaching,
raiding, and encrypting volumes as well as the firewall into which the server is started.</p>

<p>The server name template controls the name that is applied to servers that are started
according to the launch configuration. There are two approaches to naming servers as part
of the launch configuration.</p>
<p>The first approach is to just hard code a value for this field. The implications of this
are if the tier scales to include many servers, they will all be named the same thing,
which is allowed, and not always desirable.</p>
<p>The second approach is to use parameters as shown in the figure above. The available
parameters are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>{tier} name of the tier this server is running in.</li>
<li>{group} currently resolves to tier name, for backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>{count} count of this server (sequential numbering from 1 for a tier.)</li>
<li>{role} one of: CLUSTER NODE, INDEPENDENT NODE, MASTER, REPLICANT, STANDALONE (converted
to lowercase string)</li>
<li>{type} one of: LOAD, SERVICE, CLUSTERED DATABASE, REPLICATED DATABASE, UNKNOWN
(converted to lowercase string)</li>
<li>{zone} the provider zone ID where the server is running.</li>
<li>{dc} resolves the same as zone above.</li>
<li>{region} the provider region ID where the server is running.</li>
<li>{ip} reserved address (public IP) of the server.</li>
<li>{year} launch year of the server.</li>
<li>{day} launch day of the server.</li>
<li>{hour} launch hour of the server.</li>
<li>{minute} launch minute of the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach has the advantage of uniquely naming servers as they join/leave a tier in an
intelligent manner.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Recovery Point</strong></p>
<p>The recovery point parameter sets the amount of time enStratus will wait to begin a
recovery event of a failed server. A server is assumed to have failed if the agent is
unreachable, and the server is un-ping-able, or the server has stopped altogether and is
no longer being counted in the min/max.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Use Encryption</strong></p>
<p>This setting determines whether volumes attached to servers are encrypted. This option is
currently only meaningful for Linux-based servers that can employ the Linux Unified Key
Setup. This type of encryption is file-system based encryption.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Server Type</strong></p>
<p>There are five options for Server Type:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Load balancer. This option specifies a launch configuration as a load balancer so
that servers in this tier will be treated as such.</li>
<li>Service General Service. This option identifies the servers governed by this launch
configuration as a generic service such as a web application.</li>
<li>Clustered Database A clustered database is a database that is not using replication and
is therefore treated as an independent entity.</li>
<li>Replicated Database A replicated database is a database that is set up to perform
replication.</li>
<li>Unknown Similar to a service, this is a generic entry for a service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Snapshot Frequency</strong></p>
<p>This parameter sets the frequency with which enStratus automatically performs snapshots of
the attached volume. It is important to note that although there may be multiple servers
running as part of a tier, each with its own volume attached, enStratus will only snapshot
one of the volumes.</p>
<p>This highlights an important architectural consideration. Each server running in a tier
should be identical, as should the attached volumes. If variation is required in the
architecture between servers, that is an indication that an extra tier should be
configured.</p>
<p>Take care not to set the snapshot frequency too low. Snapshots lock the file system until
they are complete, which can impact your application performance. Additionally, most cloud
providers limit the number of snapshots that can be stored and if the setting is to a high
frequency, this limit may result in errors. Typically one snapshot per day is sufficient
for most applications.</p>

<p class="caption">Tier, Scaling Rules</p>
</div>
<p>Scaling rules are where the parameters that govern the scaling of tier resources.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Minimum Servers</strong></p>
<p>The minimum servers specification sets the minimum required number of servers that must be
kept running in the tier at all times. If the total number of running servers in the tier
falls below this threshold, an auto-recovery event will be triggered.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Maximum Servers</strong></p>
<p>The maximum servers specification sets the maximum allowable number of servers for a tier.
If the demand on the tier is such that additional server resources are required, enStratus
will scale up to, but not exceed, this value.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Scaling Rules</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are three options for scaling rules:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>enStratus</strong></p>
<p>enStratus scaling options are the ones shown by default. Scaling behavior is
governed by certain &#8220;hardware&#8221; parameters described here.</p>
<p>enStratus can govern scaling events by monitoring the CPU load of the servers. The CPU
load is equal to: 15-minute load average/# of CPU. For example, if the system has 2 CPU
and the load average is 0.89, the CPU threshold reading is 0.445*100 = 44.5.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Lower CPU Threshold.
The lower bound on CPU threshold. If the threshold drops
below this level and there are more than the minimum number of servers running,
servers will be terminated due to the decreased demand.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Upper CPU Threshold</p>
<p>The upper bound on CPU threshold. If the threshold rises above this level and there are
less than the maximum number of servers running, servers will be started to meet increased
demand.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Lower RAM Threshold</p>
<p>The lower RAM threshold sets the lower bound on RAM usage on a percentage used basis. If
the threshold drops below this level and there are more than the minimum number of
required servers running, servers will be scaled down due to decreased demand.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Upper RAM Threshold</p>
<p>The upper RAM threshold set the upper bound on RAM usage on a percentage used basis. If
the threshold is above this threshold and there is room available to scale, servers will
be scaled up due to increased demand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Cloud</strong></p>
<p>enStratus can also trigger scaling events based on the properties of the cloud provider.
If your cloud provider has mechanisms in place to govern scaling, enStratus will defer to
them if the cloud option is selected.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Custom</strong></p>
<p>Custom scaling rules are by far the most powerful method for controlling scaling events.
There are inherent problems with reading CPU load by default as CPU isn&#8217;t really all
that meaningful of a concept when working in a multi-tenant cloud environment where actual
CPU are load shared.</p>
<p>In short, custom scaling with enStratus means that on an interval of about 30s, enStratus
will read the output of a script called /enstratus/bin/scaleCheck. The scaleCheck script
that controls scaling behavior signals enStratus to scale up, do nothing, or scale down by
returning 1, 0, or -1, respectively.</p>
<p>A voting mechanism is used by enStratus to determine whether or not to scale the number of
servers in a group. Essentially, if the majority of servers in a server group
&#8220;vote&#8221; to scale up by returning 1, a new server will be started. If the majority
of servers in a server group vote to scale down by returning -1, a random server in that
group will be terminated. If most servers vote 0, no scaling will occur.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a scaleCheck script that was written to provide a mechanism for
applying a normalization factor to &#8220;small&#8221; servers running in EC2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">In all cases, enStratus manages the actions of initiating the scale. Each
scaling event is a server launch, and all of the orchestration/automation around that
launch is controlled using the parameters set in enStratus</p>

<p>This option tells enStratus to notify a load balancer when a scaling
event occurs that affects this service.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Replicated Database</strong></p>
<p>This option tells enStratus to treat the first server started in a tier as a master
and all subsequent servers as slaves. Please refer to the MySQL service image for
more information about this process.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Clustered Database</strong></p>
<p>This option tells enStratus to treat all database servers as peers with no

<p>Adding a service port to a service will configure enStratus to pass in the relevant port
information to the service via the enstratus.cfg file. If there is a load balancer
connected to the deployment, it will appear in the Load Balancers selection window. If a
load balancer is selected, enStratus will ensure that servers that have this service
installed upon them are connected to the load balancer upon start.</p>
<p>More specifically, if you have virtual machine-based load balancer specified, and an
application server has a service installed that is connected to the load balancer,
enStratus will call /enstratus/bin/startProxy on the load balancer after the service is
configured on the application server.</p>
<p>If a cloud based load balancer such as an elastic load balancer (ELB), enStratus will call
the correct API command to connect that server to the ELB. The cloud based load balancer
must be configured beforehand to pass traffic on the correct ports and protocols.</p>
<p>The relevant section of the enstratus.cfg file for ports is shown here:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">[</span>enstratus<span class="o">]</span>

<p class="caption">Data Source, Edit</p>
</div>
<p>A data source is tied only to database services. Data sources are database backup files
such as a datasource.sql file that have been uploaded to enStratus for use in deployments
via Automation &gt; Data Sources.</p>
<p>The figure above displays the data source configuration for a MySQL service. The available
configuration options for data sources and their functions are described here:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Name</strong></p>
<p>The name is a logical name for the data source as it will appear in the enStratus console.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Name in Database</strong></p>
<p>This configuration option ultimately becomes the name of the database itself as in the
case of a MySQL service.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>A text description of the service for human reference.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Label</strong></p>
<p>An optional color code that will be applied to the service in the enStratus console.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Service User</strong></p>
<p>The service user will be the user on the server that owns the service.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Backup Frequency</strong></p>
<p>This configuration option specifies the frequency with which enStratus calls the agent
script called /enstratus/bin/backupService. The function of this script is to call a
user-configured script called /mnt/services/$serviceID/bin/enstratus-backupDataSource. If
this script exists, enStratus will execute it and place the resulting file into cloud
storage. If not, this is a nonoperational event.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Service Password</strong></p>
<p>This parameter will become the password that can be used to connect to the data source</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Custom Configuration</strong></p>
<p>The custom configuration option is a free-form text field that can be used to pass
information to the enstratus-configure script at the time of service configuration. This
information will be contained within the enstratus.cfg file.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Data Source Image</strong></p>
<p>The data source image is the database dump file that will be used to initialize the
database named in the Name in Database field.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Owning Group</strong></p>
<p>The owning group can be assigned to the service if role based access controls are being
used.</p>

<h3>4.9.13. Dependencies<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/serviceDependencies.png"><img alt="Service, Dependencies" src="../_images/serviceDependencies.png" style="width: 500.0px; height: 150.0px;" /></a>
<p class="caption">Service, Dependencies</p>
</div>
<p>Creating an dependency means establishing a logical connection between services. For
example, an application service may have a dependency on a database service. Perhaps even
more meaningful than that, an application service may have a dependency on a database data
source.</p>
<p>Operationally, if there exists a dependency between two services, when there are changes
that affect either service such as an auto-recovery or an auto-scaling event, the other
service is notified by enStratus of this environmental change.</p>
<p>This notification process is conducted using the enstratus.cfg file which is passed to all
affected services in a tier.</p>
<p>In the figure above, an application service has a dependency on a data source installed on
a database service. If there is an auto-recovery event on a database server housing the
data source, the application services that depend on it will be notified when enStratus
passes in a new enstratus.cfg file to each of them.</p>
<p>Similarly, when changes such as an auto-recovery or an auto-scaling event occur on servers
housing the application service, the database service will be notified as well to grant or
revoke database access as necessary to compensate for changes at the application tier.
The takeaway message for dependencies is that dependencies establish logical relationships
between services that ensure the required information is passed when environment
changes occur such as a scale or recovery of a server that is running an affected service.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="delete">
<h3>4.9.14. Delete<a class="headerlink" href="#delete" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<h3>4.9.15. Versioning<a class="headerlink" href="#id5" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Maintaining the most recent version of a service is dependent somewhat on the cloud
provider. If your cloud provider has a concept of attachable block storage devices and
your services are installed upon one of them that is regularly being snapshotted, it may
be acceptable to rely on this mechanism for maintaing the most recent software. Update
your services on the running volumes, and the updates will persist once the next snapshot
is taken.</p>
<p>This approach is dependent upon the enStratus auto-recovery and scaling procedures. It is
advisable to also update the service images that are defined for each service in a tier by
uploading a new service image via Infrastructure &gt; Service Images and then pointing the
service definition to the newest version.</p>
<p>If your cloud provider has no concept of attachable block storage devices, the only option
is to take the approach of uploading the new, updated service image via Infrastructure &gt;
Service images and then pointing the service definition to the newest version.</p>
